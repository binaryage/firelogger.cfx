# CF-FireLogger

CF-FireLogger is a ColdFusion server-side library for the <a href="http://firelogger.binaryage.com/">FireLogger</a> <a href="http://getfirebug.com">Firebug</a> extension.
It enables logging of information from within ColdFusion code directly to the Firebug/FireLogger console.
An optional feature allows viewing of ColdFusions debugging information in the console instead of inline.
CF-FireLogger is a great debugging tool for any situation, and is especially useful for &quot;AJAX&quot; 
style applications where showing debug info inline isn't always an option.
CF-FireLogger can be used as a standalone feature, or integrated with CFs built-in cftrace/trace() commands.
